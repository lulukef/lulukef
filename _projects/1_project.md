This study focuses on designing a tunnel through the Cape Cod Canal to replace the aging Sagamore Bridge. The design includes the background of the project, socio-economic analysis, selection of construction method, and technical design and modeling of the alignment and section of the tunnel. The horizontal and vertical alignment of the tunnel is designed based on several national guidelines and knowledge gained during the 1.383 Underground Construction class. 
Two tunnels, each having to one-way traffic, have been designed for this project. These tunnels each have a length of 4990 meters and a diameter of 17.3 meters (56.75 feet), accommodating three traffic lanes alongside shoulders and maintenance walkways on both sides and ducts for air ventilation and utilities. The reinforced concrete precast tunnel liner is designed with a thickness of 600 millimeters. The vertical grade of the tunnel is assumed to be 4%, while a superelevation of 2.5% is provided for optimized road conditions. 
Given the lack of geotechnical data such as soil sub-surface details, traffic patterns, and socio-economic metrics specific to the site, assumptions had to be made during the design phase. To address this, we gathered data from similar nearby sites to approximate the soil profile for this project. While this report offers a detailed analysis and design of the tunnel components, it's important to note that these designs are based on the assumptions mentioned before.
This project is a simplified solution to the design problem at hand. While it highlights the main components that would constitute a complex tunnel design project such as this one, many more details and considerations would have to be accounted for in a real-world scenario.

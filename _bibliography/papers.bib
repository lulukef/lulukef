	abstract = {Landslides are a severe geohazard around the world. When moving soil masses discharge into a large water body, a tsunami can be generated and exacerbate the devastating effects of the landslide as well as extend the affected area. In this study, based on on-site geological investigation and monitoring, a numerical depth-averaged, two-phase model is established for a hypothetical tsunami in the Suofengying reservoir induced by the potential Bianjiazhai landslide in China which has been previously identified as critical. The analysis of the simulation results shows that the maximum wave amplitude measured at gauge point closest to the landslide is 31 m, and the tsunami reaches the reservoir’s dam about 66 s after the landslide initiation. The inundation map provides potential risk areas that could be affected if a landslide occurs with the anticipated characteristics. Under similar conditions, the research results will help guide reservoir operation and landslide-tsunami disaster prevention. Simultaneously, examining the sequence of events in the tsunami disaster chain facilitates the analysis of the fundamental physics governing the propagation of tsunamis within reservoirs. This analysis contributes to the prediction and prevention of landslide-induced tsunami disasters occurring along reservoir banks.},

	abstract = {Slope failure near a reservoir area is mainly influenced by rainfall and reservoir water fluctuation. This study provides insights into the deformation and failure process of the Bianjiazhai landslide near the Suofengying reservoir located at the Wu River in Guizhou province, China. Firstly, stability analyses were carried out to assess the overall strength of the slope and identify the most vulnerable section of the site. Secondly, transient hy­ dromechanical analyses were performed to analyze the effects of rainfall and the reservoir water level fluctua­ tions on the selected slope. The hydromechanical analysis is divided into three different scenarios to study combined as well as the individual effects of rainfall and reservoir water level fluctuation on slide formation. The results indicate that the sudden reservoir water level fluctuations are critical for the stability of the slope. Strength reduction analyses confirm that the deformation behavior of the slope is dominated by shear slip phenomena and identify relevant shear zones. The numerical results from both hydromechanical and stability analysis indicate that the stability of the slope is greatly reduced during large and sudden drawdown. The results from this study will be useful for preventing landslide disasters and for guiding reservoir operation in a similar context.},

	abstract = {Most granites have preferred directions (“rift”, “grain”, and “hardway”) that affect the ease with which the rock can be split. In this study, we present a series of uniaxial and triaxial tests on the directional-dependent properties of Sierra White Granite, a rock that has been chosen as a laboratory analog for the FORGE site granitoid. We performed triaxial tests on 1.5” by 3.5” cylindrical cores involving a test program including isotropic compression, cyclic loading, and triaxial compression in three preferred directions under low to high confining pressure. In these tests, we measured stress, displacement, axial and circumferential strain, and P-wave velocity. We found no significant degree of direction dependency in the deformation (stiffness) and strength parameters. On the other hand, the P-wave velocity results show the largest velocity along n ̂\_C (direction perpendicular to plane C) then n ̂\_A and n ̂\_B.  More tests are needed to accurately quantify the direction-dependent behavior of the given test material.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

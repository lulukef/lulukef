Laxman Kafle is a PhD student in [Prof. Herbert Einstein's](https://herbert-einstein.org/) lab in [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.mit.edu/). He completed his Master's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), China and undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal in Civil Engineering. His research interests include geothermal energy, fracture mechanics, and numerical modeling.

I am interested in geo-rock mechanics, geothermal energy, and experimental geotechnique. Beyond my research, I am deeply committed to promoting sustainability and addressing the environmental challenges we face. I believe that the most significant breakthroughs occur when we collaborate and share knowledge. I'm always open to partnerships, discussions, and interdisciplinary projects with like-minded professionals.
